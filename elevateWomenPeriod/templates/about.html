<p class="subheading text-start py-4"> Our mission statment: </p>
<p class="paragraph text-start"> Elevate Women Period is the creation of two friends, Dadi Masusa and Crystal Briden. Young women in Zimbabwe often leave school or are absent for periods of time due to menstruation challenges. These girls often have no education in regards to female health and lack basic sanitary pads. The goal of this trust is to provide health education and reusable sanitary pads to these young women. Our secondary goal is to encourage the education of young girls through providing school supplies and educating young women about the importance of continuing their education.
